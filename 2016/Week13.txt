Jeremy Hsu
Playoffs were so close yet so far. This was the story of Jeremy's season. 
Zain Mithani
First year in the league and Zain makes the playoffs. That's a nice feather in his cap.

Ryan Gregurek
<br>Ford: Ryan, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you. I do.<br>Ryan: What the hell are you talking about?<br>Ford: You needed time. Time to understand your enemy. To become stronger than them. And I'm afraid in order to escape the Sacko, you will need to suffer more. And now, it is time to say good-bye, old friend. Good luck.<br> 
Ronny Kwon
Top seed in the Sacko playoffs, may the odds be ever in your favor.  
Samantha Kuhn
Sam just sacrificed her TE's to the fantasy gods for a victory in the Sacko playoffs (I hope). 
Billy Juch
These violent delights have violent ends.
