Tim is straight trolling everyone now. Cam is going ham with Kelvin, he avoided a serious injury with DT, this team is deep and looking pretty (just like the owner)
Samantha Kuhn
She didn't even need Crowell this week to win. With CJ and Fitzy going off, and Gurley + Gronk in the wings just waiting to explode, Sam is sitting pretty right now
Matt Bui
With Woodhead out for the year, Melvin should benefit the most. Diggs is looking like a stud with bradford, and Antonio will have much better days. 
Zain Mithani
Even though Zain won by only 0.1 pts, this team is legit. Mike Evans, Forte, and Blount are a solid core for the rest of the year. 
Billy Juch
The injury bug bit Billy hard this week, his RB situation is in trouble. It's up to Decker, Cooks and Luck to carry this team until his RBs are fixed. 
Jon Thibeault
Deangelo is bae
Pauline Han
David Johnson is looking like a great pick for rest of the year. AR15 should have bigger games ahead. This team just needs more depth.
Ronny Kwon
Odell will have better days ahead, and Snead is looking like a great buy. 
Jeremy Hsu
Tough loss, Jameis will bounce back against easier defenses. Theo Riddick will be a stud if Ameer misses time
Michael Nguyen
Jamaal is supposed to come back this week. Mikey needs him to turn this team around from 0-2
Ryan Gregurek
Losing AD  stings, as Ryan's RB situation was already hurting. Hopefully it's not serious. At least Carr is beasting. 
Hal Peters
just lol
