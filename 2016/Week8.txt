Matt Bui
True to his word, Bui came on everything Ryan loves.
Jeremy Hsu
Huge Carr explosion from Jeremy to derail the Mikey comeback train.  
Pauline Han
This week the Teenage Mutant Ninja Allens strategy did pay off. Next up is Cowboy Hal with half of Pauline's team on bye. 
Jon Thibeault
just lol
Zain Mithani
A solid showing this week, garbage time Bortles might be your savior this year. Then again, it's Blake Bortles. 
Ryan Gregurek
You benched big dick Riddick. This loss is on you and you alone. 
Samantha Kuhn
You had the Troll in the palm of your hand, and ya blew it.  
Hal Peters
Hal's all Cowboys draft strategy (5 years in the making) is finally paying dividends.
Ronny Kwon
Jameson - Ronny's favorite drink and apparently his favorite NFL player first name. 
Michael Nguyen
It is not comeback time yet. 
Billy Juch
All of your team is playing like a cuntcussed.
