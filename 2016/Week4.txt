The Troll King just keeps winning baby. Even when Cam goes down, he has Tom Brady just waiting in the wings to replace him this week. Somebody please beat this guy. 
Matt Bui
Booz gets wrecked this week, but this team is still dangerous AF. My only complaint is he keeps our Lord and Savior William Vincent Fuller the Fifth rotting away on his bench.  
Pauline Han
Well well well. Another week, another solid win for Pauline who takes down the undefeated Zain. DJ + Christine + AR, oh me oh my. 
Samantha Kuhn
Gurley is looking slightly busty, but Crowell is looking like the real deal to make up for it. And Jordan Reed is just 100% stud. 
Zain Mithani
Even with a down week from a bunch of your players to give Zain his first loss, he still puts up a respectable score. He needs the muscle hamster back soon, as it looks like Forte is fading. 
Jon Thibeault
Le'Veon's back, time to ball. 
Jeremy Hsu
JULIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. That is all. 
Ryan Gregurek
Ryan is quietly winning games and moving up. Devonta and Emmanuel are looking to be consistent threats every week. 
Billy Juch
Another down week for Bill. Losing Decker and Stewart definitely hurts, but I look at this team and it's decidedly "meh" right now.
Hal Peters
Zeke has arrived. Too bad the rest of your team hasn't. 
Michael Nguyen
Taking advantage of Ronny's hurt team to get OBJ was smart. The rest of your season now rests on a guy with macaroni for hair. 
Ronny Kwon
I don't know what to say, I can't even look at you.
