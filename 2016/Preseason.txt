After embarassing himself and the whole state of Minnesota by spending $135 on Andrew Luck last year, it looks like Tiny Tim drafted a great team with lots of depth. Will 2016 be the year of the troll?
Matt Bui
Antonio Brown and Lamar Miller, oh my god I'm so erect right now.
Zain Mithani
Zain's first year in the league, and this draft shows he's no scrub. I see no real weakness anywhere.
Jeremy Hsu
I like the shady pick, and Duke Johnson has high breakout value. Also JULIOOOOOOOOOOOO.
Michael Nguyen
Your season depends on Jamaal's health. If it holds up the watch out. Lots of depth everywhere here too. 
Samantha Kuhn
Spending $$$ on two expensive TE's was not smart, but a solid draft otherwise. Got Fitz for cheap, C.J. is already exploding, and Texans D is bae. 
Jon Thibeault
It's me
Billy Juch
Fat lacy should have a bounce-back year, Ameer has high breakout value, and props for having a white WR. I just can't get the bad taste of Luck out of my mouth from last year. 
Pauline Han
Newcomer Pauliner made some pretty solid picks. David Johnson and AR15 are a good core. She just had way too much leftover money at the end of the draft, could have gotten more depth. 
Ryan Gregurek
Autodraft actually got you some legit players. 
Ronny Kwon
lol dak
Hal Peters
