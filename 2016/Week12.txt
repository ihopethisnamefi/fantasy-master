Our record for most wins in a season is 11, Booz has a chance to tie it this week. 
Luan Nguyen
Lu was trolling the last 3 shots, but sank a cup in rebuttal to keep him above the table. 
Pauline Han
Win this week and you're in the playoffs, lose and things get interesting for other teams. 
Jon Thibeault
Praying for a miracle against Booz. 
Michael Nguyen
Well well look who put together a 4 game win steak to stay out of the sacko playoffs. 
Jeremy Hsu
I don't think there's anyone else who had as many tough losses as Jermy this year. I smell a sand rivalry brewing with Zain in that division. 
Zain Mithani
Zain beats Jeremy at the buzzer to win the divison and launch himself to the post season.  
Hal Peters
Your cowboy comeback was valiant the 2nd half of the season, but it's most likely too little too late to make the playoffs. 
Ryan Gregurek
Looks like someone has a date with Billy next week. 
Ronny Kwon
Sacko playoffs aren't a guarantee yet, win and you have a chance to be worry free the next 4 weeks. 
Samantha Kuhn
Next year I think I'm changing the flex to include TEs too because of your team, at least you have that.
Billy Juch
Up or down? Up or down? DOWN DOWN DOWN.
