The troll stays on top above the table. Kelvin laid an egg but a solid performance from everyone else gave him the win. 
Matt Bui
Fuck this kid. Marvin Jones is looking like a surefire top 10 WR, and booz gets to pair him with AB and Diggs for the best WR core in the league. 
Zain Mithani
Evans is a TD machine, and Blount is beasting. It'll be interesting to see if he keeps his production when Brady comes back. 
Pauline Han
Pauline is silently climbing up the rankings. Christine Michael has finally arrived, which will pair great with DJ. We all knew ARob would return to normal, which spells doom for the rest of her division. 
Samantha Kuhn
Gurley finally does well and the rest of her team has a down week. 
Jon Thibeault
I need Le'Veon back pronto. 
Ryan Gregurek
Huge explosion this week from Ryan to jump up the rankings. Can Devonta keep this up?
Jeremy Hsu
Another solid performance turns into a loss. Jeruhhmeeee has caught some bad breaks. At least Shady is back, and Julio should have way better days. 
Billy Juch
What happened to this team? Bill is plummeting down the rankings. 
Ronny Kwon
Ronny's team is dead. Matthews/Langford/Rawls/Snead/Walker, much wow. 
Hal Peters
Hey you moved up!
Michael Nguyen
HAAALLLPPP!!!
