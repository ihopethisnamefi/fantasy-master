Luan Nguyen
You are one lucky SOB this week, but I can never stay mad at Tiny Tim. 
Matt Bui
Jay Ajayi joins O.J. Simpson, Earl Campbell, Ricky Williams, and Jeffrey Nguyen as the only players to rush for 200 yds in back to back games. Next time don't leave him on your bench, eh?
Jeremy Hsu
This Shady situation is quite the condundrum, you pulled through this week because your team is well rounded enough to make up for him. And because you played Hal. 
Pauline Han
The double wide receivers from Jacksonville is a bold strategy. This week it did not pay off. 
Jon Thibeault
Ihatethisgame.
Ryan Gregurek
Ty Montgomery gets the coveted RB designation this week. He could be the pickup of the year for Ryan. 
Zain Mithani
Zain will not go quietly into the night, and comes back this week with a 133 point surge. 
Samantha Kuhn
That Maclin/CJ trade ain't looking too hot for Sam.
Michael Nguyen
Is it...is it...is it comeback time yet?
Billy Juch
Kenny Britt returns to cuck status this week. 
Ronny Kwon
Son I am still disappoint.
