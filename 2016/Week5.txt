Luan Nguyen
Guru has fallen. Let's keep this trend going. 
Matt Bui
Booz has done what no man, woman, or child can do and defeated the pure evil that haunts this League. The selection committee still like Tim slightly ahead in the rankings though. 
Jon Thibeault
Bell is love, Bell is life. 
Jeremy Hsu
Jeremy narrowly wins this week after the MNF performance from Greg the Leg. This team is still solid up and down. 
Pauline Han
All of Pauline's bye week players costed her the win this week. DJ is looking like the best pick of the draft so far. 
Samantha Kuhn
Tough loss to swallow after Fitz balls out early. But what's this I see? Your Gronk is showing? 
Zain Mithani
Zain's RB's are fading fast, he needs the muscle hamster healthy ASAP. 
Ryan Gregurek
Hopkins, Asiata, and Riddick had great performances......on Ryan's bench. He just needs to sit back, relax, recalibrate, and not fuck up next time. 
Hal Peters
Zeke carried Hal's team to a victory over his arch rival from Korea by a point. This is the most excited he's been since he woke up from under a car and didn't die. 
Billy Juch
Bill's $28 Marvelous Martellus pickup saved him this week, but there was still a much needed showing from the rest of his team. 
Michael Nguyen
Mikey puts up the 2nd highest point total this week, only to go against Hal with the top score. He just cannot catch a break this year. I smell a mangina in the air...
