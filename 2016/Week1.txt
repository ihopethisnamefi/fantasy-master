Billy Juch
It looks like Luck is having a bounce back year, which does not bode well for the rest of us. If Ameer keeps up this pace, and the Drew -> Brandin connection keeps happening, watch out rest of league. Bill is straight Cookin. 
Matt Bui
We already knew Antonio, Lamar, and Rodgers will have monster years, but with Melvin Gordon breaking out, booz is looking at a special season ahead
Luan Nguyen
AJ Green is exploding, and even with Cam having a down game he still scored 21.2 points. Let's hope the Demaryius injury is not that serious. This team is deep and well rounded, just like the owner. 
Samantha Kuhn
Even with Gurley having a down game, Sam still put up 116 points due to some good sleeper picks. Fitz just doesn't age, and CJ anderson could be a workhorse all year for Denver. Maybe drafting two expensive TE's was smart afterall, with Gronk being injured. 
Pauline Han
Pauliner's first fantasy game is showing she belongs, taking down seasoned veteran Ronny. David Johnson should have a great year, and wow Baldwin is producing like last year and you got him for dirt cheap. Also Eli <3, hopefully he keeps this up. 
Zain Mithani
Not bad. Forte is still producing like in Chicago, and Evans is a TD machine. Should have a solid upcoming year. 
Michael Nguyen
Lost but still put up 104.5 points. Spencer Ware oh my gee, whoever you play at RB for KC should have a big year. Let's hope Russell's ankle injury is not serious. 
Jeremy Hsu
Again, not bad, still put up 103.5 points in a loss. Winston is looking like a great pick, and Julio should have bigger games. 
Jon Thibeault
Keenan. Sammy. Shit. 
Ronny Kwon
welp
Ryan Gregurek
AP should have bigger games, but ehhhhhhh.
Hal Peters
lol
