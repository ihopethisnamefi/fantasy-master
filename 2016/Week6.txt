Another week another loss, yet the Troll stays on top of the table again due to his solid roster score and his ability to throw up like a dragon. 
Jeremy Hsu
This guy fucks.
Matt Bui
Not even the best RB in the league AKA Lamar Miller could save Booz from the wrath of Pauline. 
Pauline Han
"Hi my name is Pauline, first year in the league I'm pretty green; My running backs are DJ and Christine, in the end I'll be the Queen."
Jon Thibeault
Welp fuck a doodle doo
Ryan Gregurek
Terrance West exploded this week, looks like Ryan found another solid RB.  
Samantha Kuhn
You are Mikey's first win of the season. I don't know what else to say. 
Zain Mithani
What was once the most Gucci looking team in the league is now fading fast. Looks like Hal cursed you. 
Billy Juch
When Cooks is hot so is this team. Bill needs to pray to the old Gods and the new to keep him going. 
Ronny Kwon
Looks like things are trending up! If only you had some stud receiver with a penchant for kicking nets your team would be the talk of the town. 
Michael Nguyen
Mikey's team suddenly looks scary. If you haven't played him yet, prepare for his vengeance.
