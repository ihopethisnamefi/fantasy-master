Matt Bui
God damn dude.
Jon Thibeault
Prosise died for my wins. 
Luan Nguyen
Loser of 3 straight. AJ Green out forever. Ingram cuntcussed. Guru is in real danger of missing the playoffs. This week is do or die against a surging Pauliner.  
Pauline Han
Pauline vs Troll should determine who wins the illustrious Two And A Half Men division title. Time to go bawls to the Rawls. 
Jeremy Hsu
Likewise, there are only two contenders remaining in the Three Men division. Can Jeremy get his revenge after his .3 loss against Zain from earlier in the season?
Zain Mithani
Zain vs Jeremy should be a thriller, grab your popcorn. 
Michael Nguyen

Hal Peters
Not even the 9-1 cowboys could stop the Bui Juggernaut. 
Ronny Kwon
A solid effort this week, use what you've learned to stay out of the Sacko Bowl. 
Ryan Gregurek
Mexico City screwed both the Texans and Ryan out of a win. This is definitely Matt Leal's doing.  
Samantha Kuhn
I can't guarantee you'll get a goat this week, but I can guarantee you'll soon be playing for a nipple piercing. 
Billy Juch
Welp here we are again.
